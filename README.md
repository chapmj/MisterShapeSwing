# MisterShapeSwing

Major update to MisterShape.  Splitting to a new project for simplicity.  I'd prefer to keep the old version.

## Goals
  * Review code, bugfix and refactor based on what I have learned.
  * Update to a more recent JRE.
  * Correct gradle build problems.
  * Add logging
  * Add tests
  * Migrate to JavaFX (possibly a separate version).
